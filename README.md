# EPAM Todo App

Simple Todo App where we display past due items on top of the list and completed items at bottom. This items are supposed to be fetched from a remote server, but for now we're faking the data using the `data.ts` file inside the `fixture` folder 

# How to run it

You can run the following instructions in order to run the project using your favorite node package manager:

```bash

    pnpm run dev
```

## How to run the test

You can run the following instruction to run the test in watch mode:

## Upcoming features

There is a chance we can include an Input where the user can add a new task to the Todo List.
